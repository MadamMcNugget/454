This package includes three demos for drawing a colored cube using different prjection matrices: orthogonal, frustum and perspective, respectively. 

OpenGL version 3.0 and GLSL 130 are supported. 

To compile and run the demo, type the following command in the terminal: 
			make run
and use keyboard (e.g. 'o', 'p', 'r', etc.) to control. 

By default, the ortho demo is compiled. Change the line 20 in the makefile accordingly to test the other two demos.
